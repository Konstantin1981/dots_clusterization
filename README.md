# dots_clusterization

### Task 3: 
Clustering spatial data. The input is a raster (in jpg format) and a list of points (in raster coordinates). It is necessary to combine "close" points into clusters and display each cluster on the raster with one icon.

Optional: the ability to set the degree of "proximity". Optional: displays the number of origin points that fall into each of the clusters.

### Realization

jupiter noteboock experiment:

generating test data as rnd clouds of dots

clusterization - scipy/centroid linkage

optimization of cut-off distance
